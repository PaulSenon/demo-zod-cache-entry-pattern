# Zod Cache Entry Pattern Demo

This repository is the demo project linked to this article I wrote on Medium: TODO

But if you're too lazy to read here is the basics things you need to know:

* This repository is not meant to be build or anything. It juste give you a buildtime environment to play with this zod cache entry pattern and see how typechecking is handled. Is will also work at runtime because this part is handled by the zod library.
* You can read comments and play with the `src/index.ts` file
* to run this project, just clone this repo, run `pnpm install` then open it in your favorite IDE handling Typescript hints by default and voil√†.
